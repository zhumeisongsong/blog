Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a concept introduced by Eric Evans in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software. 

## What kind of issue that DDD could help to resolve?

It focuses on aligning the software design with the business domain it aims to serve.
The results of requirements analysis and design could not be directly implemented as code, while the code that could run often failed to fully realize business functions. This caused frequent software bugs, making maintenance, upgrades, and rewrites difficult.
DDD is particularly useful in complex domains where understanding and modeling the business logic is crucial for creating effective software. It encourages collaboration between developers and domain experts and aims to build systems that closely align with business needs.

## What is the concept of Domain Model?

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) breaks down this barrier by introducing the concept of a domain model, unifying analysis, design, and programming. This allows the software to more flexibly and quickly adapt to changing requirements.
