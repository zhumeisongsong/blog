## Product Basic Information

To build a online interactive learning service to help users learn happily.

Detail user stories are:

- User could explore learning topics.
- User could take quiz game to test their knowledge and learn new knowledge.
- User could get real-time feedback on each question.
- User could receive result of answering the quiz.
- User could get rewards to be more motivated to improve.
- User could get recommend of new topics or quizzes based on the learning history and areas of weakness.
- User could revisiting past quizzes.

## Strategic Design

Strategic design is the process of

- Identifying **domain objects** and aggregate **roots** based on **user journey** analysis
- Clustering **entities** and **value objects** into aggregates
- Dividing **bounded contexts**
- Establishing **domain models**

The way to do the strategic design is **event storming**, it includes:

- product vision
- scenario analysis
- domain Modeling
- microservices Splitting

Who should join the Strategic design?

- domain experts
- business requirement side member
- product manager
- architect
- project manager
- development manager
- test manager

### 1.Product Vision

Product vision is the top-level value design of the product, which reaches consensus on information:

- the product's target users
- core values
- differentiated competitive points

to prevent the product from deviating from its direction.

During the event storming, all participants write their opinions on each key point on stickers and stick them on the whiteboard. The event storming host will discuss each sticker and converge and unify the divergent opinions to form **the product vision map** below.

<!-- mermaid -->

```mermaid
graph LR
A(For) --> B(Age of 6-18)

C(Their) --> D(Learn knowledge of geography)

E(This) --> F(Web interactive learning service)

G(Is) --> H(Quiz game)

I(It could) --> J(Take quiz game)
J --> K(Get real-time feedback on each question)
K --> L(Receive result of answering the quiz)
L --> M(Get rewards to be more motivated to improve)

N(It's not) --> O(Reading-centered learning with fixed content)
O --> P(Listening-centered learning with fixed content)

Q(It is) --> R(Dynamic questions generated by AI)
```

<!-- mermaid -->

Organized above info into **a paragraph**:

We build a web interactive learning service to help the 6-18 years old users learn knowledge of geography by quiz game. It's not like traditional reading-centered or listening-centered learning way with fixed content, it provides dynamic questions generated by AI.

Product vision analysis is valuable for startup systems to clarify system building priorities, unify team building goals and establish a common language. However, if your system goals and requirements are very clear, this step can be ignored.

### 2.Scenario Analysis

Scenario analysis starts from the user's perspective, explores typical scenarios in the business domain, and produces **scenario classifications**, **use case operations**, and **dependencies between different subdomains that need to be supported in the domain** to support domain modeling.

Project team members **use event storming to analyze the user journey**. According to the journey and scenario analysis of different roles, all operations, commands, domain events, external dependencies and other information from front-end operations to back-end business logic are sorted out as comprehensively as possible.

**Scenario 1 User Begins Learning**

**Scenario 2 User Completes a Quiz and Receives Feedback**

### 3.Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is to establish a domain model by analyzing the business and issue domain.

It guides the microservice boundary design through **bounded context** upwards and guides the entity objects design through **aggregation** downwards.

<!-- mermaid -->

```mermaid
graph LR
E(Domain modeling) --bounded context--> D(microservice boundary design)
E --aggregation--> F(entity objects design)
```

<!-- mermaid -->

Domain modeling is a convergent process, divided into 3 steps:

Step1: Find out the domain objects such as entities and value objects.

Based on the scenario analysis, analyze and find out the entities and value objects that initiate or generate these commands or domain events. Aggregate the commands and events related to entities or value objects to the entities.

<!-- mermaid -->

```mermaid
classDiagram
class User Entity{
  RegisterUserCommand
  LoginUserCommand
  UpdateUserProfileCommand
  StartNewQuizCommand
  UserRegisteredEvent
  UserLoggedInEvent
  UserCompletedQuizEvent
}

class Quiz Entity{
  GenerateNewQuizQuestionCommand
  SubmitQuizAnswerCommand
  EndQuizCommand
  QuizQuestionGeneratedEvent
  QuizAnswerSubmittedEvent
  QuizEndedEvent
}

class KnowledgePoint Entity{
  CreateKnowledgePointCommand
  UpdateKnowledgePointCommand
  DeleteKnowledgePointCommand
  KnowledgePointCreatedEvent
  KnowledgePointUpdatedEvent
  KnowledgePointDeletedEvent
}

class RewardSystem Entity{
  GrantPointsCommand
  UnlockAchievementCommand
  UpdateLevelCommand
  PointsGrantedEvent
  AchievementUnlockedEvent
  LevelUpdatedEvent
}

class LearningProgress Entity{
  RecordLearningProgressCommand
  AdjustQuestionDifficultyCommand
  LearningProgressRecordedEvent
  LearningReportGeneratedEvent
}

class AIQuestionGenerator Entity{
  GeneratePersonalizedQuestionCommand
  GenerateLearningReportCommand
  PersonalizedQuestionGeneratedEvent
  QuestionDifficultyAdjustedEvent
}

```
<!-- mermaid -->

By aggregating commands and domain events into entities and value objects, we are able to specify the responsibilities and behavior of each domain model in the system. 
In a micro services architecture, this aggregation also helps us to design the core functionality of each microservice and define how services interact with each other.

Step2: Define the aggregation

- User Aggregate
- Quiz Aggregate
- Knowledge Aggregate
- Learning Progress Aggregate
- Reward System Aggregate


Step3: Define the Bounded Context

- User Management Context
- Quiz Management Context
- Knowledge Management Context
- Learning Progress Context
- Reward System Context

### 4.Microservices Splitting

Theoretically, a bounded context can be designed as a microservice, but it is also necessary to consider a variety of external factors, such as:

- single responsibility
- separation of agile and stable business
- non-functional requirements (such as elastic scaling, version release frequency and security requirements)
- software package size
- team communication efficiency
- technical heterogeneity
- other non-business factors.

For now, Let's divide microservices mainly considering the principle of single responsibility.

At this point, the strategic design is over. Through strategic design, we have established domain models and divided the microservice boundaries.

The next step is tactical design, which is also microservice design. Let's take the **quiz generated micro service** as an example to explain its design process.

## Summary

DDD Strategic design starts with event storming, then we have to find out the domain objects such as entities, find out the aggregation root to build the aggregation, delineate the bounded context and build the domain models.
