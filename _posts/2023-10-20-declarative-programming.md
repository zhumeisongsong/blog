### Imperative Programming vs Declarative Programming
Imperative: 
- how to do
- POP(procedure-oriented)
- Please turn right to go to the station

Declarative:
- what to do
- OOP(object-oriented)
- Please take me to the station


### Reason 1: One of the oldest promises of the object-oriented
- defining an object
- defining object's function

### Reason 2: AI copilot friendly
- AI likes you `ask what you want` instead of you tell AI how to do it.
- ai will think and provide `how` in order to solve your `what`.

### Reason 3: Easy to maintain
- determined inputs and determined outputs
- no side effect
- easy to read
- test cases could cover the function use cases
