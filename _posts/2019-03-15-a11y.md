Web accessibility refers to designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can use them effectively. This means ensuring that web content is usable for everyone, including those with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual impairments. Accessibility also benefits individuals without disabilities, such as people with temporary injuries, older adults, and those accessing the web under challenging conditions.

## Accessibility Guidelines and Standards

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: The most widely used standards, published by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). The current version, WCAG 2.2, includes guidelines at three levels: A (basic), AA (recommended for most websites), and AAA (highest level of accessibility).

**Section 508**: U.S. government standard requiring federal websites and electronic information technology to be accessible.

**ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**: While not specific to the web, the ADA mandates accessibility for digital content in certain contexts.

## Tools and Practices for Web Accessibility

**Screen Reader Testing**: Tools like NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver help test content for users relying on audio output.

**Color Contrast Checkers**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (e.g., Contrast Checker by WebAIM).

**Keyboard Navigation**: Test websites without a mouse to ensure functionality.

**Automated Accessibility Scanners**: Tools like Axe, Lighthouse, and WAVE identify common accessibility issues.

**User Feedback**: Engage users with disabilities for usability testing.
