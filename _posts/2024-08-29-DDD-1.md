### Deadline-driven development

Given a deadline, as long as in this deadline before the completion of the required functionality can be.

- No system design
- No architecture
- Lack of process management
- Only the pursuit of short-term business goals

As a result, the corresponding code may be a lumpy mess that is difficult to extend and maintain, laying a huge technical pit for the future.

### Data-driven design

The most commonly used software design approach.
Focuses on the specific business data to be carried.

- First by identifying the corresponding business data entities
- Then complete the design of the database tables
- Then through specific business processes to connect these data together to complete the software design.

In some `simple small systems`, the use of this design approach is completely sufficient.

### Domain-driven design

The systems we touch are getting bigger and bigger, involving more and more subsystems, and the traditional software design methods can no longer satisfy us to deal with `the design of complex systems`. 

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a concept introduced by Eric Evans in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software. 

- DDD focuses on aligning the software design with the `business domain` it aims to serve., drives the software design of the whole system through the `domain model`
- `Makes that domain model decoupled from the data model`
- `Clarifies the business boundary`
- DDD is not a form of architecture, it is a `guiding philosophy` for architectural design and a `methodology` for dealing with complex domain problems

## You may not need DDD

DDD is  an architectural design methodology for dealing with software complexity. You may not need DDD is your software is simple and small.

What's the mean of software complexity? Or What factors contribute to the complexity of software design?

## DDD 's value

## Key Concepts

## What is the concept of Domain Model?

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) breaks down this barrier by introducing the concept of a domain model, unifying analysis, design, and programming. This allows the software to more flexibly and quickly adapt to changing requirements.
