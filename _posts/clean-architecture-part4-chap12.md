If the SOLID principles tell us how to **arrange the bricks into walls and rooms**, then the component principles tell us how to **arrange the rooms into buildings**.

Large software systems, like large buildings, are **built out of smaller components**.

Components are the units of **deployment**. They are **the smallest entities** that can be deployed as part of a system.

Well-designed components always retain the ability to be independently deployable and, therefore, independently developable.

These dynamically linked files, which can be plugged together at runtime, are the software components of our architectures. It has taken 50 years, but we have arrived at a place where component plugin architecture can be the casual default as opposed to the herculean effort it once was.
