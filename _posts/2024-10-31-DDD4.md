## Summary

Tactical design starts with the commands of event storming, identifying and designing services, establishing dependencies of services at each layer, designing entities and value objects within the microservices, identifying all domain objects in the microservices, and establishing the mapping relationship between domain objects and code objects.

This will be a good way to guide the product development and testing.
