## What kind of issue that DDD could help to resolve?

The results of requirements analysis and design could not be directly implemented as code, while the code that could run often failed to fully realize business functions. This caused frequent software bugs, making maintenance, upgrades, and rewrites difficult.


## What is the concept of Domain Model?

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) breaks down this barrier by introducing the concept of a domain model, unifying analysis, design, and programming. This allows the software to more flexibly and quickly adapt to changing requirements.
