Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. - Alan Kay 

If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to `a single individual`.

Refactoring: Periodically refactoring to simplify complex logic or integrate new best practices can keep the codebase healthy and easier to maintain.

Error Handling: The way errors are handled and displayed is clear, but consider centralizing error handling if similar patterns are used across different components.

Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time. - Alan Perlis

If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. - Frank Wilczek
