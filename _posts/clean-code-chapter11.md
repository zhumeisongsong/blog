## How Would You Build a City? 如何建造一个城市
Cities also work because they have evolved appropriate levels of abstraction and modularity that make it possible for individuals and the "components" they manage to work effectively, even without understanding the big picture.

## Separate Constructing a System from Using It 将系统的构造与使用分开

## Scaling Up 扩容

## Java Proxies Java代理

## Pure Java AOP Frameworks 纯Java AOP框架

## AspectJ Aspects AspectJ的方面

## Test Drive the System Architecture 测试驱动系统架构

## Optimize Decision Making 优化决策

## Use Standards Wisely, When They Add Demonstrable Value 明智使用添加了可论证价值的标准

## Systems Need Domain-Specific Languages 系统需要领域特定语言

## Conclusion 
Systems must be clean too. An invasive architecture overwhelms the domain logic and impacts agility. 

At all levels of abstraction, the intent should be clear. This will only happen if you write POJOs and you use aspect-like mechanisms to incorporate other implementation concerns noninvasively.

Whether you are designing systems or individual modules, never forget to use `the simplest thing that can possibly work`.
