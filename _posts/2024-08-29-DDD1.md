### :green_apple: Deadline-driven development

Given a deadline, as long as in this deadline before the completion of the required functionality can be.

- No system design
- No architecture
- Lack of process management
- Only the pursuit of short-term business goals

As a result, the corresponding code may be **a lumpy mess** that is difficult to extend and maintain, laying a huge technical pit for the future.

### :green_apple: Data-driven design

The most commonly used software design approach.
Focuses on the specific business data to be carried.

- First by identifying the corresponding business data entities
- Then complete the design of the database tables
- Then through specific business processes to connect these data together to complete the software design.

In some **simple small systems**, the use of this design approach is completely sufficient.

### :green_apple: Domain-driven design

The systems we touch are getting bigger and bigger, involving more and more subsystems, and the traditional software design methods can no longer satisfy us to deal with the design of **complicated systems**.

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a concept introduced by Eric Evans in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.

- DDD focuses on aligning the software design with the **business domain** it aims to serve., drives the software design of the whole system through the **domain model**
- Makes that **domain model** decoupled from the **data model**
- Clarifies the **business boundary**
- DDD is not a form of architecture, it is a **guiding philosophy** for architectural design and a **methodology** for dealing with complex domain problems

## :avocado: You may not need DDD

DDD is an architectural design methodology for dealing with software complexity. You may not need DDD is your software is simple and small.

What's the mean of software complexity? Or What factors contribute to the complexity of software design?

### :green_apple: High complexity of business logic

Take the e-commerce business for example, there are dozens of micro-service categories:

- product service
- user service
- storage service
- order service
- points service
- coupon service
- logistics service
- ...

When there are many business systems, business boundaries are not clearly delineated due to historical reasons, and there are **various dependencies between systems**. Once a big project that involves many sub-domain systems comes.

### :green_apple: Business requirements change quickly

Market requirements change quickly, and the business is this process today, and it will change tomorrow.

### :green_apple: Difficulty in cross-team collaboration

A large project, in many cases, requires the cooperation of various sub-domain teams to complete the whole chain of business. If there is no unified business language, then it will lead to low communication efficiency between teams, or even a reduction in business communication layers. **Repeated communication between teams** will also increase the communication cost of designers and developers.

As mentioned above, we need to **design software architectures** that take into account **how we can better realize requirements**, **better respond to changing**, and **better collaborate with others** to achieve them.

## :avocado: What does a software architect really do?

- Selecting a worthy challenge (aimed at creating value)
- Complicating simple matters in thought (managing risks and preparing for the future)
- Simplifying complex matters in action (delivering quality products while controlling costs)
- Articulating complexity in a simple manner (ensuring successful knowledge transfer)

## :avocado: DDD 's values

- Unified business and development languages
- Clearly express core business semantics through domain models
- Clarify business boundaries
- Separation of domain model and data model to effectively isolate the unchanging core business from the changing requirements and enhance the ability of the architecture to cope with changes.

## :avocado: Core Concepts

### :green_apple: Unified Language

In DDD, it is necessary to establish **a set of unified language among domain experts, product teams, and development teams**, so that everyone can agree on the level of description of domain knowledge, thus solving the problem of communication and collaboration among various teams.

- Unified domain terminologies: such as SKU in the inventory domain, each team knows that SKU represents the unit of measurement of the inventory in and out, so that in the business discussion, the mention of SKU we all know the meaning of what it stands for, and do not need to carry out too much explanation of the description.
- Unified domain actions: such as in the inventory domain involves the goods on the shelf action is unique to the domain, so we can see that the domain action is a kind of behavioral description from the perspective of the domain model **rather than a specific implementation perspective**.

### :green_apple: Domain Models

Definition: A domain is what an organization does and everything that is included in it. Business organizations usually identify a market and then sell products and services within that market. Each organization has its **own scope of business** and its **own way of doing things**. This scope of business and the activities carried out within it are the domain.

**In the user order shopping scene:**

- User browsers the products
- User selects the product to place an order
- Order service generates the order
- Points service increases the user's shopping points
- Storage service deducts the storage of the product
- Coupon service issues new coupons to users
- Logistics services will take over subsequent logistics information

**For realize the scene above, E-commerce business domain would have sub-domains:**

- Orders
- Points
- Storages
- Coupon

<!-- mermaid -->
graph TB
  A(User Domain) -->B(E-commerce Domain, Sub is Order,Points,Coupon,Logistics)
  B --> C(Storage Domain)
<!-- mermaid -->

Across the business team, domain experts, designers, and developers need to have a unified understanding of the domain model that **everyone agrees on**.

How do we separate the different domain models?

In fact, by bounding the context.

### :green_apple: Bounded Context

A domain model is a model of software described using the same language, and each domain model has corresponding attributes and actions that need to be in a specific context in order to have a specific meaning.

For example, notebook in the field of stationery then it is a paper recording tool, the same notebook this three words but in the 3C field, it refers to our commonly used laptop. The same name but in a different border context represents a completely different meaning.

## :avocado: Summary
Here we have explained **what DDD is** and **analyzed the complexity of software architecture design**, so we need DDD as a complicated architecture analysis method to assist us. 
In the next article, we will introduce the implementation steps of DDD, as well as several common practices.
