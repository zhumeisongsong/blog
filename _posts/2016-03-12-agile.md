## Responding to Change > Following a Plan

This is in contrast to a Waterfall methodology where all the plan is done up front.

The idea of **planning a roadmap** and **committing to long term deadlines** is not agile.

Agile is about being able to adapt and change course as you learn more about your product throughout its development.

Because engineers are human. We don't all solve problems in the same way. Instead of trying to mitigate the unpredictable nature of software engineering, we make it a part of how we work.

Just as the architecture and code becomes clearer as you go along, more importantly, so does the problem we're solving.

## Costumer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation

- user interview
- feedback feature
- A/B test

## Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation

- CI/CD
- MVP
- fail fast

## Individual and Interactions > Processes and Tools

Focus on people and collaboration.

- not document-driven
- not heavyweight
