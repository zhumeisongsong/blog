# Chapter 3: Functions

Functions are the first line of organization in any program.
- What is it that makes a function `easy to read and understand`? 
- How can we make a function `communicate its intent`? 
- What attributes can we give our functions that will `allow a casual reader to intuit the kind of program they live inside`?

## Small!

## Do One Thing

## One Level of Abstraction per Function

## Switch Statements

## Use Descriptive Names

## Function Arguments

## Have No Side Effects

## Command Query Separation

## Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes

## Don't Repeat Yourself

## Structured programming

## How Do You Write Functions Like This

## Conclusion
Every system is built from a `domain-specific language` designed by the programmers to describe that system. Functions are the `verbs` of that language, and classes are the `nouns`.
The art of programming is, and has always been, the `art of language design`.
Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written. They use the facilities of their chosen programming language to construct a much richer and more expressive language that can be used to tell that story. Part of that domain-specific language is the hierarchy of functions that describe all the actions that take place within that system. In an artful act of recursion those actions are written to use the very domain-specific language they define to tell their own small part of the story.

Functions should be short, well named, and nicely organized. 
But never forget that `your real goal is to tell the story` of the system, and that the functions you write need to fit cleanly together into a clear and precise language to help you with that telling.
