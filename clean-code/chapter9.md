# Chapter 9: Unit Tests

## The Three Laws of TDD

First Law You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test. 
Second Law You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not com-piling is failing.
Third Law You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the cur-rently failing test.

## One Assert per Test
